<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Who are you?</h2>
<p>I am <b>John P Holbrook</b>, a high school student, robotics enthusiast, and amateur programming enthusiast based in

<h2>What do you do?</h2>
<p>Like most people my age, I spend most of my time sleeping, eating, or attending school. When I'm not busy doing any of those things,
	I'm usually involved in one of my hobbies, which include robotics, computing, sailing, playing the viola, and gently correcting
	people on reddit who use the term "LEGOs".</p>
